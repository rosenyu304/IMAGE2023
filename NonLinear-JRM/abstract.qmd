## Objectives/Scope (100 words, 600 characters)

In time-lapse seismic monitoring, weak 4D signal below the level of inversion or migration artifacts pose challenge to the robustness of time-lapse imaging. To address these challenges, low-cost randomized non-replicated acquisitions and linear joint recovery model (JRM) have been introduced which takes advantage of the fact that the time-lapse seismic data and subsurface structure undergoing localized changes share information between different vintages of seismic data. Since the relationship between seismic data and subsurface properties is seldom linear, we propose a non-linear JRM which is an extension of linear JRM with non-linear forward modeling operator.

## Methods, Procedures, Process (250 words, 1500)

In linear JRM, for two vintages of seismic data, three unknown parameters are inverted - common component $m_0$ and two innovations ($\delta m_1$ & $\delta m_2$) with respect to this common component and there is a linear relationship between the parameters and seismic data. But in non-linear JRM, we take advantage of the full non-linear relation, $\textrm{F}$, between them such that our minimization objective becomes 
$$
\min_{m_0, \delta m_1, \delta m_2} \Phi(m_0, \delta m_1, \delta m_2) = \frac{1}{2} || \textrm{F}(m_0 + \delta m_1)  - d_b ||_2^2 + \frac{1}{2} || \textrm{F}(m_0 + \delta m_2)  - d_m ||_2^2
$$

where $\textrm{F}$ is the non-linear forward modeling operator, $d_{b}$ and $d_{m}$ are baseline and monitor seismic data and $||$ is the $\ell_2$ norm operator. This is a standard least squares problem that can be solved by gradient-based stochastic optimization. Although the gradients with respect to three parameters require PDE solves and seems quite expensive, the complexity reduces drastically with some mathematical simplifications of the gradients and the optimization becomes tractable.

In the experimental setup for CO~2~ monitoring, we took a 2D velocity slice from the Compass model, simulated two-phase flow and obtained a time-lapse change in the subsurface. In order to image this change, we simulated randomized non-replicated time-lapse seismic data and inverted it using non-linear JRM. The dimension of the model was 5970m X 1545m. The source and receiver intervals were 100m and 60m respectively. The total number of sources used was 48. 

## Results, Observations, Conclusions (250 words, 1500)

Figures 1 (a) and (b) show independent and joint recovery respectively for the replicated acquisition and figures 2 (a) and (b) show same for the non-replicated acquisition. In these figures, the first and second rows show recovery of baseline and monitor images respectively, the third and fourth rows show inverted and ground truth time-lapse differences. In both cases, time-lapse amplitudes of the JRM look superior compared to independent recovery in terms of being artifact-free and less noisy. This is because JRM exploits the information shared between the baseline and monitor surveys. Moreover, non-replication artifacts can be clearly seen in the independent time-lapse recovery case (Figure 2(a)) which is drastically reduced in JRM and it looks very similar to JRM for a replicated case. This strengthens our argument for a low-cost randomized non-replicated acquisition in the time-lapse seismic survey for GCS and that there is no need to fully replicate the surveys between baseline and monitor. 

The recovery of the vintages and their time-lapse difference is measured by the degree of repeatability which is mathematically determined by the normalized root mean square (NRMS) value. While NRMS can vary between 0 to 200% theoretically, its lower value indicates superior recovery. In this study, the nrms value for the JRM in the case of the replicated and non-replicated surveys are 0.5% and 1.2% respectively and the SNR value between the ground truth and recovered time-lapse is -2.02 dB and -7.1 dB respectively.

## Significance/Novelty (100 words, 600)

To our knowledge, this is the first study on the application of non-linear JRM with non-replicated time-lapse data for geological carbon storage. The current paradigm vouch for independent imaging and replicated time-lapse surveys which is expensive and often require uneconomical dense sampling of the wavefields. But with the proposed new technique, we argue that there is no need for a fully replicated expensive time-lapse survey, rather non-replicated surveys are sufficient to provide an artifact-free time-lapse signal with JRM.
