## Objectives/Scope (100 words)

Before a geological carbon storage project, reservoir engineers need permeability model(s) to predict CO~2~ dynamics in the Earth subsurface via fluid-flow simulation. However, the permeability model is never known accurate enough beforehand, which can lead to wrong CO~2~ plume predictions. Through the coupled physics inversion framework, we show that time-lapse seismic data can be used to invert for the permeability model. This results in better CO~2~ plume recovery for the past vintages, and more accurate predictions for future snapshots. The accurate predictions help practitioners to estimate storage capacity of the reservoir, and prevent risks such as CO~2~ leakage through fractures.

## Methods, Procedures, Process (250 words)

We adopt the coupled physics inversion framework that involves three kinds of physics, namely fluid-flow, rock, and wave physics. The fluid-flow equations model the CO~2~ plume evolution in the Earth subsurface according to permeability of the reservoir. The rock physics modeling maps the time-varying CO~2~ concentration in the rocks to the time-varying changes of acoustic wavespeed of the rocks. Finally, seismic modeling generates time-lapse seismic data for each vintage based on the wavespeed of the rocks. A schematic workflow is shown in Figure 1.

Given observed time-lapse seismic data, we invert the nested physics modeling operators for the permeability in an end-to-end fashion. The inverted permeability can be used to generate time-varying CO~2~ concentration snapshots that match observed time-lapse seismic data. Without further collected seismic data after the injection is terminated, practitioners can also run fluid-flow simulation on the inverted permeability with their own choices of injection rate/location to forecast the CO~2~ plume in the future and estimate the storage capacity of the reservoir.

## Results, Observations, Conclusions (250 words)

We conduct a near realistic numerical study on Compass model, which is currently considered as a potential site for geological carbon storage. We convert the compressional wavespeed in the model to log permeability values to make up alternating high and low permeability layers in the reservoir with a seal on the top. We inject 1 million metric ton CO~2~ per year in a highly permeable layer for 25 years. CO~2~ tends to move into high permeability layers (over 1000 millidarcies) and move up due to buoyancy effects. We shoot 5 vintages of crosswell seismic data at every 5th year, with a ricker wavelet with central frequency 20 Hz.

We start inversion with homogenous permeability values in the reservoir. After 12 datapass of gradient descent iterations with back-tracking line search, the CO~2~ plume recovery from the inverted permeability is shown in Figure 2 (a). The extent of the plume looks drastically different than the initial prediction on the homogeneous permeability, but reasonably similar to the ground truth ones with acceptable errors. We recover the high and low permeability layers upon which CO~2~ plume has ever touched in these 25 years, shown in Figure 2 (b). We do acknowledge errors on the recovered permeability, especially at the locations upon which CO~2~ plume has not touched.

We stop the injection at the 25th year and keep simulating the CO~2~ plume for another 25 years. The CO~2~ plume forecast from inverted permeability is again close to the ground truth ones with acceptable errors in especially near-future snapshots.

## Significance/Novelty (100 words)

We consider this as the first numerical case study that brings the coupled physics inversion framework to a realistic Earth model as a potential geological carbon storage site. We convert the wavespeed model based on well logs and imaged seismic to a finely discretized permeability model with realistic heterogenous layers. We conduct the fluid-flow simulation following a professional solver based on JutulDarcy.jl, which correctly models near realistic two-phase compressible flows with capillary pressure effects. This near-realistic synthetic study confirms that coupled physics inversion can be used in geological carbon storage projects to estimate and forecast CO~2~ plume evolution.
