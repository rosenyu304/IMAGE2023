## Objectives/Scope (100 words)

Understanding CO~2~ plume behavior is key to the success of geological carbon storage projects. While two-phase flow equations provide a good model to make predictions on future CO~2~ plume behavior, these equations rely on having access to the spatial permeability distribution. Unfortunately, accurate information on the permeability distribution is unavailable, which greatly jeopardizes our ability to predict CO~2~ plume behavior. To overcome this problem, we estimate the permeability from time-lapse seismic data via a coupled inversion methodology that is capable of producing CO~2~ plume predictions that improve as more seismic monitoring data becomes available.

<!--Before a geological carbon storage project, reservoir engineers need permeability model(s) to predict CO~2~ dynamics in the Earth subsurface via fluid-flow simulation. However, the permeability model is never known accurate enough beforehand, which can lead to wrong CO~2~ plume predictions. Through the coupled physics inversion framework, we show that time-lapse seismic data can be used to invert for the permeability model. This results in better CO~2~ plume recovery for the past vintages, and more accurate predictions for future snapshots. The accurate predictions help practitioners to estimate storage capacity of the reservoir, and prevent risks such as CO~2~ leakage through fractures.-->

## Methods, Procedures, Process (250 words)

To obtain information on the spatial permeability distribution, we adopt coupled physics inversion framework that involves three kinds of physics, namely two-phase fluid-flow, rock, and wave physics. The fluid-flow equations model the time evolution of the CO~2~ saturation and pressure given the permeability distribution. The rock physics modeling turns the time-varying CO~2~ saturation into time-varying changes of the acoustic wavespeed. Finally, seismic modeling generates time-lapse seismic data for each vintage based on the wavespeed of the rocks. A schematic of this multiphysics forward model is shown in Figure 1.

Given observed time-lapse seismic data, we invert the three nested physics modeling operators for the permeability. The inverted permeability can be used to generate time-varying CO~2~ concentration snapshots that match observed time-lapse seismic data. Aside from obtaining estimates for the CO~2~ plume's past and current behavior, constrained by the two-phase flow equations, the proposed inversion methodology is thanks to the inverted permeability also capable of producing CO~2~ forecasts. These forecasts can be produced for different injection scenarios allowing for interventions designed to optimize productivity and minimize risks.

<!-- UNREADABLE Without further collected seismic data after the injection is terminated, practitioners can also run fluid-flow simulation on the inverted permeability with their own choices of injection rate/location to forecast the CO~2~ plume in the future and estimate the storage capacity of the reservoir.-->

## Results, Observations, Conclusions (250 words)

To gain insight on the performance of our inversion scheme, we conduct a realistic numerical study based on the North Sea Compass model whose geology is very similar to sites currently being considered as a potential site for geological carbon storage. For this purpose, we convert the compressional wavespeed in the model to log permeability values to make up alternating high- and low-permeability layers in the reservoir with a seal on top. We inject 1 million metric ton CO~2~ per year in a highly permeable layer for 25 years. During and after injection, the CO~2~ tends to move into high permeability layers (over 1000 millidarcies) and move up due to buoyancy effects. To monitor the CO~2~ plume seismically, we shoot 5 surveys of crosswell data every 5th year, using a Ricker wavelet with a central frequency of 20 Hz.

We start the inversion with homogenous permeability values in the reservoir. After 12 data passes of gradient descent with back-tracking line search, the CO~2~ plume recovery from the inverted permeability is shown in Figure 2 (a). The extent of the plume looks drastically different from the initial prediction based on the homogeneous permeability, but reasonably similar to the ground truth CO~2~ plumes simulated from the true unknown permeability distribution. <!--UNREADABLE We recover the high and low permeability layers upon which CO~2~ plume has ever touched in these 25 years, shown in Figure 2 (b). We do acknowledge errors on the recovered permeability, especially at the locations upon which CO~2~ plume has not touched.--> As expected, we only obtain information on the permeability from regions that are touched by the CO~2~ plume during the first 25 years of injection. While the inverted permeability captures only part of the true permeability distribution, it improves drastically on plume forecasts for the next 25 years compared to those obtained from the starting model for the permeability.

<!--We stop the injection at the 25th year and keep simulating the CO~2~ plume for another 25 years. The CO~2~ plume forecast from inverted permeability is again close to the ground truth ones with acceptable errors in especially near-future snapshots.-->

## Significance/Novelty (100 words)

To our knowledge, this is a first numerical study where a multiphysics inversion framework is applied to a realistic geological carbon storage site. Not only are the fluid-flow simulations based on a proxy model for the permeability derived from real imaged seismic and well data but the simulations, including sensitivity calculations, are carried out with a state-of-the art solvers (\[JutulDarcy.jl\]), which accounts for capillary effects and residual trapping (purple colors). <!--We convert the wavespeed model based on well logs and imaged seismic to a finely discretized permeability model with realistic heterogenous layers. We conduct the fluid-flow simulation following a professional solver based on JutulDarcy.jl, which correctly models near realistic two-phase compressible flows with capillary pressure effects.--> From this example, we observe that the proposed inversion methodology can be applied to geological carbon storage projects to estimate and forecast CO~2~ plume evolution.
