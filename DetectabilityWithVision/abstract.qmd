## Objectives/Scope (100 words)

- succesful detection
- needs improvement and degrades
- augment dataset
- to improve results

Global deployment of geological carbon storage (GCS) technology hinges on alleviating possible risk factors such as reservoir leakage. Reservoir leakage can successfully be observed with seismic imaging and the leakage detection process can be automated with machine learning. However, the performance of the trained networks is contingent on building a dataset for each new receiver configuration in a seismic experiment, leading to meticulous and high-cost data collection/generation procedures. In this study, we aim to improve the detection generalization of a network, trained on only a particular seismic receiver configuration, by proposing an augmentation to its training dataset.


## Methods, Procedures, Process (250 words)

The dataset generation procedure commences with multiple 2D proxy velocity models constructed as a representative of a potential GCS site in the South of the North Sea. To train the classification networks, we create a training set of seismic images of CO~2~ plumes that behave regularly (without leakage) and irregularly (with leakage). In this approach, we make use of a rock physics model to convert time-varying CO~2~ concentrations in the reservoir to variations in the acoustic wavespeed that we image with reverse time migration (RTM). The CO~2~ plumes themselves are modeled by the two-phase flow equations in an assumed to be known model for permeability.  we observe the time-lapse difference between baseline and monitor images. RTM utilizes equally spaced 162 receivers and jittered 32 sources configuration. The resulting RTM time-lapse images is used to form training dataset of network, based on Vision Transformer. The ultimate purpose of the network is to distinguish between regular and irregular seismic images of reservoir by performing binary classification and the overall training workflow can be seen in Figure 1(a).

To test the network's performance in different receiver configurations, we reiterate the RTM with different number of receivers placed periodically. The generated time-lapse difference images form the test set. As shown in Figure 1(b), 200 receiver configuration produces high-quality, artifact-free reservoir difference images, whereas for 20 receiver configuration setting the reservoir is very noisy. Therefore, before performing the testing experiment, we hypothesize that the network trained on one specific receiver configuration may face performance issues on images generated by different configurations.


## Results, Observations, Conclusions (250 words)

The testing accuracy results of the network, trained initially on 162 receiver setting, is shown in Figure 2(a). It can be seen that the detection accuracy of the model is significantly high in receiver configurations more than 162 receivers and gradually decreases in the following configurations. After approximately 100 receivers, the binary classification results become equivalent to random. 

To uplift the general accuracy performance of the network, we enlarge the training dataset by including examples of difference images produced by random receiver configurations. Considering the fact that dataset augmentation introduces a new cost to our framework, we specifically included random, low-cost examples with number of receivers less than 162. After the dataset augmentation process, we can observe that the classification accuracy for all configurations has been significantly increased, shown in Figure(2a). Moreover, the confusion matrix performance metrics(precision, recall and F-1 score) have been substantially improved.

The results show that dataset augmentation can enhance the generalization of network and contribute to its detection performance. In terms of practical use, this work suggests a dataset based on a particular seismic setting can be made more applicable to different imaging experiments with the inclusion of cheap random examples in the training dataset.


## Significance/Novelty (100 words)

To our knowledge, our study is the first numerical study to frame the problem of detectability of seismic CO2 leakage images in GCS reservoirs using a ML based network model. Additionally, the study proposes a dataset augmentation technique to improve the generalization of the network to scenarios with different acquisition settings, notably different number of receivers. The results suggest that our study has the potential to lower the cost associated with dataset collection, create networks applicable to general seismic imaging schemes and expedite the leakage detection process with an automatic workflow.
