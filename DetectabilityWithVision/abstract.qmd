## Objectives/Scope (100 words, 600 characters)

In previous work, we have shown that neural classifiers can be trained to detect CO~2~ leakage from time-lapse difference data. While this result is key to global deployment of geological carbon storage (GCS), it success depended on relatively dense non-replicated time-lapse data acquisition. By augmenting the training set with different receiver samplings, we aim to improve the CO~2~ leakage detection capabilities while making it more robust with respect to low-cost coarse non-replicated receiver samplings, e.g. with ocean bottom nodes (OBNs).

<!--relatively cje technology hinges on alleviating possible risk factors such as reservoir leakage. Reservoir leakage can successfully be observed with seismic imaging and the leakage detection process can be automated with machine learning. However, the performance of the trained networks is contingent on building a dataset for each new receiver configuration in a seismic experiment, leading to meticulous and high-cost data collection/generation procedures. In this study, we aim to improve the detection generalization of a network, trained on only a particular seismic receiver configuration, by proposing an augmentation to its training dataset.-->


## Methods, Procedures, Process (250 words, 1500)

To create a suitable training set, we derive permeability models from 2D proxy models with a geology representative for potential GCS sites in the South of the North Sea. These models are derived from 3D imaged seismic and well-log data and contain realistic heterogeneity. Given these permeability models, we create a training set of imaged CO~2~ plumes that behave regularly (without leakage) and irregularly (with leakage). After generating the baseline and monitor surveys, time-lapse images are created reverse time migration (RTM). The CO~2~ plumes themselves are modeled with two-phase flow equations.

To create high-fidelity images, we deploy 162 receivers and 32 jittered sources. Given, these images we train our visual classifier based on a Vision Transformer network. As we can observe from Figure 1(a), this classifier meets out ultimate purpose of distinguishing between regular and irregular flow by performing binary classification. While encouraging the training and test images all rely on high-fidelity images obtained with densely sampled OBNs. Unfortunately, in practice we can not rely on dense receiver sampling because of the associated high costs. This is problematic because the quality of the time-lapse difference image and the classifier's performance both deteriorate (Figure 1(b)). We overcome this problem by augmenting the training data with time-lapse difference images obtained from a plurality of acquisition geometries with varying receiver samplings.

## Results, Observations, Conclusions (250 words, 1500)

From Figure 2(a), we observe that the testing accuracy of a network trained initially on 162 receiver setting performs well for acquisition geometries with more receivers but its accuracy degrades gradually when the number of receivers becomes smaller rendering the classifier useless for 100 receivers. 

To compensate for this loss in performance and to improve its overall performance, we augment the training dataset with time-lapse difference images obtained for acquisition geometries with randomly varying numbers of receivers (BETWEEN WHAT AND WHAT?????). After training with the augmented dataset, we observe that the classification accuracy for all configurations has been increased significantly as  shown in Figure (2a). Moreover, the confusion matrix performance metrics(precision, recall and F-1 score) have also improved substantially.

These results show that dataset augmentation can indeed enhance the generalization of our neural classifier and contributes to its detection performance. In terms of practical usage, this work suggests a dataset based on a particular seismic time-lapse acquisition geometry can easily be made applicable to different geometries by adding time-lapse difference images obtained with complementary random acquisition geometries to the training dataset.

## Significance/Novelty (100 words, 600)

To our knowledge, this is a first study how to make neural classifiers for CO~2~ leakage detection more robust with respect to variations in receiver density. To achieve this, we propose a simple dataset augmentation technique that improves generalization of the network to changes in the acquisition geometry. The results suggest that our study has the potential to lower dataset collection costs while training classifiers capable of automatic leakage detection from time-lapse difference images computed from non-replicated surveys with varying receiver density.
