We introduce a learned framework that extends the conventional computationally reductive linear source superpositions (simultaneous sources) to a non-linear learned superposition and its corresponding super-shot. With this method, we can obtain an image of the subsurface at the cost of a single shot migration by learning the most informative superposition of shots."

Because of the linearity, the same linear transformation can be applied both to the source and data to keep the problem well posed. Here, we introduce a non-linear superposition, and to compensate for the inability to apply the corrsponding transform to the source, we simultenously learn both the non-linear source and non-linear data with a neural network. This networks takes the shot records as input and outputs the learned supershot and simultenous source. The network is trained in two ways. First we train a supervised network minimizing the difference between the migrated non-linear supershot and the true model perturbation which requires access to the true model. Since in practice the true subsurface image is unknown, we train a second unsupervised network minimizing the difference between the true data and the migrated-demingrated supershot."

We shot the learned super-shot and simultenous source next to the true observed data and compare the obtained one-shot subsurface image with standard multi-source RTM and conventional random simultenous sources imaging. We see that the image is not only less noisy that the standard simultenous source image but also a better representation of the subsurface than the conventional RTM. This demonstrate that we can obtain a good image of the earth at the cost of a single source migration while avoiding the artifacts associated with conventional simultenous source imaging."

    "text": "Methodology\nWe now introduce the formulation of aour learned simultenous source-data pair for seismic imaging. We derive two training problem where the first onbe rely on the knowledge of the true perturbation, while the second one solely rely on the observed data. Fundamentally, we are introducing a formulation that learns the most informative single super-shot and correspoinding source given either a subsurface refelctivity model or the surface recorded data.\n\nSummary networks and probabilistic symmetry\n(Deans 2002) -Summary statistics reduce the size of incoming datasets while maintainting the same posterior distribution p(x|y) = p(x|summary) (Radev et al. 2020) -Summary networks learn to reduce the size of incoming datasets and maximize informativeness of the summarized data due to joint learning of summary network and posterior learning network. -hand waves an argument that jointly trained networks will maximize the mutual information between h(y) and x (Müller et al. 2021) -Goes in to further detail and rigoursly proves that jointly trained networks will maximize the mutual information between h(y) and x (Bloem-Reddy and Teh 2020) suggests to use learned layers that are invariant under a certain transformation. This transformation is described by the probabilistic assumption on your data.\nExample paragraph: This work takes inspiration from the concept of a summary network (Radev et al. 2020) these are networks that compress observables \\(d_{obs}\\) while maximining information useful for inference of un-observables \\(x\\). To guide the architectural design of a summary network (Bloem-Reddy and Teh 2020) suggests to use learned layers that respect the probabalistic symmetry of the data. Practically, this is accomplished by making the layers be invariant under a certain transformation. For the case active source seismic imaging, i.i.d sampling entails the assumption that the order of sources does not matter. This assumption is implicit in the sum structure of RTM/gradient calculations. Therefore it is invariant with respect to permutation transformation. Our approach is most similar to this case, since we use a UNet with many input channels that output a single channel. In our testing, having a separate network for each dataset did not perform better thatn simply inputing each dataset along a channel.\n\n\nSupervised\nTHe simplest formulation aims to learn the super-shot and simultenaous source that best inform the model perturbation, given the surfac recorded data. Mathematically, it means that we are trying to fit the true mode lperturbation with two networks that learn a single super-shot and simultenous source for the Jacobian from the indicudual field recorded shot records. Mathematically, the learning can be written as: \\[\n\\min_{\\theta, \\phi} \\ \\mathbb{E}\\left[ J(\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi}(\\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}(d_{\\text{obs}}))^\\top \\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}(d_{\\text{obs}}) - \\delta m \\right]\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi}, \\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}\\) are the two networks mapping the individual shot records into a single super-shot (the learned simultenous-source is learned at the receiver locations), \\(J\\) is the conventionnal adjoint Born imaging operator, \\(d_{\\text{obs}}\\) is the observed data and \\(\\delta m\\) is the model perturbation. We note that to compute an update on the two networks simultenaously, the gradient of the Jacobian with respect to its source is necessary. This derivative is however trivial to obtain with JUDI.jl thanks to its high-level linear algebra abstraction and integration with automatic differentiation framework in Julia.\n\n\nUnsupervised\n\\[\n\\min_{\\theta, \\phi} \\ \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\tilde{J}_{\\text{rtm}} J(\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi}(\\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}(d_{\\text{obs}}))^\\top \\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}(d_{\\text{obs}}) - \\tilde{d}_{\\text{obs}} \\right ]\n\\tag{2}\\]\nWhere \\(\\tilde{d}_{\\text{obs}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_src} w_i d_{\\text{obs},i}\\) is a random super shot with \\(w_i := \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\) and \\(\\tilde{J}\\) is the corresponding simultenous source born modeling operator. While this formulation ivolves an additional demigration (and therfore and additional migration to compute hte gradient), we do not require any knowledge of the true model perturbation but only the data. We could therefore in theory use this formulation for a wide range of datasets at once to generalize to any survey."

We then split this dataset into 1600 slices for trainng and 400 slices for testing. For each 2D slice, we generate 21 shot records. One of the main advantage of our one-shot imaging method is that we only require a single migration-demigration per iteration. Therefore, we can perform 21 epochs before arriving to a computationnal cost equivalent to the plain standard RTM imaging of each slice. Since we only perform 15 epochs, our method is overall cheapper than computing the RTM on every single shot if we include the cost of training.\nWe trained the networks, both in the supervised and unsupervised case, for 15 epochs with a learning rate of \\(.0004\\) using the Adam optimizer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTMs\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Learned super-shot and simultenous sources on a testing slice.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Before a geological carbon storage project, reservoir engineers need permeability model(s) of the reservoir to predict CO2 dynamics in the Earth subsurface via fluid-flow simulation. However, the initial permeability is never known accurate enough beforehand, which can lead to wrong CO2 plume predictions. Through the coupled physics inversion framework, we show that time-lapse seismic data can be used along with the project to invert for the permeability model. This coupled physics inversion results in better CO2 plume recovery for the past vintages, and more accurate CO2 plume predictions in the future. The accurate predictions helps practitioners to estimate of the reservoir storage capacity along with the ongoing project, and prevent potential risks such as CO2 leakage through fault and fractures."

    "text": "Methods, Procedures, Process (250 words)\nWe adopt the coupled physics inversion framework that involves three kinds of physics, namely fluid-flow, rock, and wave physics. The fluid-flow equations model the CO2 dynamics in the Earth subsurface according to permeability of the reservoir. The rock physics modeling maps the time-varying CO2 concentration in the rocks to the time-varying changes of acoustic wavespeed of the rocks. Finally, seismic modeling generates time-lapse seismic data for each vintage based on the wavespeed of the rocks. A schematic workflow is shown in Figure 1.\nGiven observed time-lapse seismic data, we invert the nested physics modeling operators for the permeability in an end-to-end fashion. The inverted permeability can be used to generate time-varying CO2 concentration snapshots that match observed time-lapse seismic data. Without further collected seismic data after the injection is terminated, practitioners can also run fluid-flow simulation on the inverted permeability with their own choices of injection rate/location to forecast the CO2 plume in the future and estimate the storage capacity of the reservoir."

We convert the compressional wavespeed in the model to log permeability values to make up alternating high and low permeability layers in the reservoir with a 50m depth seal on the top. We inject 1 million metric ton CO2 per year in a highly permeable layer for 25 years. CO2 tends to move into high permeability layers (over 1000 millidarcies) and move up due to buoyancy effects. We shoot 5 vintages of crosswell seismic data at year 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25, with a ricker wavelet with central frequency 20 Hz.\nWe start inversion with homogenous permeability values in the reservoir. After 12 datapass of gradient descent iterations with back-tracking line search, we recover the high permeability layers upon which CO2 plume has ever touched in these 25 years, shown in Figure 2 (a). We do acknowledge errors on the recovered permeability, especially at the locations upon which CO2 plume has not touched. The predicted snapshots of CO2 plume from the inverted permeability are shown in Figure 2 (b), which looks drastically different than the initial prediction on the homogeneous permeability, but reasonably similar to the ground truth ones.\nWe stop the injection at the 25th year and keep simulating the CO2 plume for another 75 years. The predicted CO2 plume from inverted permeability is again close to the ground truth ones with acceptable errors in especially near-future snapshots."
